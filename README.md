## Introduction
If you develop or use marine electronics, Signal K server has something to offer for you. This document explains how you can take advantage of the Signal K server for your needs.  

### Boaters and Boat Owners
For boaters, Signal K server runs in the background and makes functionality and data available to other apps and devices. One of its most popular features is to make data from the navigation  system, such as position, course, speed as well as AIS targets. This information is then easily accessible from popular apps like Navionics, iSailor, iNavX, Aqua Map and WilhelmSK via the WiFi network.

Signal K  can also take care of the anchor watch, be a weather station and an automatic logbook. And as a final example, it can turn your boat into a MarineTraffic station which may give free access to 
[their professional plans](https://help.marinetraffic.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017183497-As-a-station-owner-am-I-entitled-to-a-free-Subscription-).

If you are a boat owner, you can easily run Signal K on a Victron Cerbo GX, RaspberryPi or similar hardware. To take full advantage of a Signal K server, you will probably want to connect it to your boat network via NMEA 0183 or NMEA 2000 but it is not a requirement.

### Marine Vendors
For Marine vendors who build marine hardware and software, for example those developing navigation, monitoring and tracking systems, SIgnal K server is an opportunity to accelerate development and decrease time to market, by taking advantage of a proven, modern and extensible software platform that is open source and available with a permissive Apache 2.0 license. Signal K server is implemented in Node.js and is easy to integrate into modern systems that run Linux derivatives and is already running on systems developed by Victron Energy, Airmar Technology and others.

### Software Developers
There are many boaters who happen to be highly skilled software developers. If you are one of them, Signal K offers you a free and open platform developed by boaters for other boaters like you, who want to build themselves and optionally share with other boaters. Signal K features an extensible [plugin framework](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/blob/master/SERVERPLUGINS.md), [web applications](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/blob/master/WEBAPPS.md) as well as a rich set of [REST](https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/rest_api.html) and [Streaming APIs](https://signalk.org/specification/1.7.0/doc/streaming_api.html). Signal K server takes care of all the complicated parts of protocol decode, and conversions to and from NMEA2000, NMEA0183 and many more protocols. It makes the data available in JSON format according to the [Signal K standard specification]. This allows developers to bypass all the hurdles typically encountered when wanting to implement something for a boat. [Getting started](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/blob/master/SERVERPLUGINS.md) is surprisingly easy.

## Signal K Platform

There is more Signal K Platform than just Signal K Server. Signal K encompasses three major components:

1. **The Signal K Data Standard**: an open marine data standard. It is a modern data format for marine use, suitable for WiFi, cellphones, tables and the internet. Signal K server is build  data standard specification. is Built on standard web technologies including JSON, WebSockets and HTTP, Signal K provides a method for sharing information in a way that is friendly to WiFi, cellphones, tablets and the Internet. More information on [https://signalk.org](https://signalk.org/index.html).is part of the Signal K platform
2. **Signal K Server**: Software in this GitHub repository and described in this document. Signal K server is a full stack application developed in Node.js. Its back-end multiplexes data from and to NMEA0183, NMEA 2000, Signal K and other marine protocols, as well as WiFi, LAN and Internet, and provides APIs and websockets for access and control. Its front-end provides an extensible web-based application allowing easy configuration and management of server functions and capabilities.
3. **Signal K Plugins and Webapps**: Built using the extensibility of Signal K Server with a plugin framework, allows developers to develop applications that easily integrate with Signal K server, extend its capabilities and publish them through npm. All published plugins become available in all existing Signal K server installations, which provides an easy distribution mechanism.

## How to get Signal K Server?

For the typical boater, not being a software developer nor electrical engineer, the best option is to get a (commercially available) product that already has Signal K Server inside. These are the currently available devices:

* AIRMAR SOMETHIGN (TBD); WHICH IS SIGNALK-SERVER INSIDE
* [Cerbo GX](https://www.victronenergy.com/panel-systems-remote-monitoring/cerbo-gx) and other GX Devices by Victron Energy  ([see Venus OS Large manual](https://www.victronenergy.com/live/venus-os:large))

For a more technical DIY oriented boater, a RaspberryPi based setup offers a very cost-attractive alternative.
These prebuilt images for RaspberryPis take away most of the complexity involved from the software side:

* [BBN Marine OS](https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/lysmarine_gen#what-is-lysmarine-bbn-edition)
* [OpenPlotter](https://openmarine.net/openplotter) by OpenMarine
* [Venus OS for RaspberryPis](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/raspberrypi-install-venus-image) by Victron Energy
* [Signal K docker images](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/tree/master/docker)

Next level up is to use provisioning scripts:

* [MarinePi Provisioning](https://github.com/tkurki/marinepi-provisioning) - Ansible scripts to setup RaspberryPi for boat use

Another level up, this document explains how to install Signal K Server, as well as its dependencies, on a RaspberryPi that is already running Raspberry Pi OS:

* [Installation on a RaspberryPi](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/raspberry_pi_installation.md)

HERE NEEDS TO BE A NICE BRIDGE TO NEXT PART; WHICH IS ABOUT INSTALLING FROM NPM, THEN CONFIGURATION, THEREAFTER MORE DEVELOPER ORIENTED STUFF ABOUT GITHUB, AND LINKING TO THE VARIOUS OTHER README'S ABOUT PLUGINS, WEBAPPS, RESOURCE API ETC.

## Installing from source

### Install from npm

Prerequisites:
* Node.js version 16 with latest npm installed (signalk-server works for the time being on Node version >=10, but we are moving to the latest LTS version that is v16 in 9/2021)

    $ sudo npm install -g signalk-server

Now you can start the server with sample data:
* NMEA0183 sample data: `signalk-server --sample-nmea0183-data`
* NMEA2000 sample data: `signalk-server --sample-n2k-data`

To generate your own vessel settings file and configure the server to start automatically, run:

    $ sudo signalk-server-setup

### Install from git

```
git clone https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server.git
cd signalk-server
npm install
npm run build:all
```

Start the server with sample data:
* NMEA0183 sample data: `bin/nmea-from-file`
* NMEA2000 sample data: `bin/n2k-from-file`

This will start the server with a sample configuration file and the server will start playing back data from a sample file under `samples/`. The data is available immediately via the REST interface at https://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/api/.

This small demo shows how to connect the Signal K Server WebSocket interface from the command line:
```
npm install -g wscat2
wscat 'ws://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/stream?subscribe=all'
```

## Configuration and use
Now what?
---------

Once you have the data streams in place you probably want to use the data or at least see it in a nice format. Some sample plugins and apps are installed during the installation process.
- Apps or Webapps are mainly web pages for accessing the Signal K output such as dashboards, configurable gauges or web maps. See [Webapps doc](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/WEBAPPS.md) for more information.
- If you have internet connectivity for your server App Store in the admin user interfaces shows all the Signal K Plugins and Apps that have been published via npm with the right keywords. It also shows their current status on your server and allows you to install and update these.
- Plugins add extra features to tailor your server to your needs, change parameters or get information from various sources. See [Server Plugins](SERVERPLUGINS.md)

Configuration
=============

Please take a look at the different settings files in the `settings` directory and read the [brief intro](http://blog.emilecantin.com/web/sysadmin/iot/javascript/sailing/2016/03/19/arduino-signalk-part-2.html).

You can specify the settings file via command line with `bin/signalk-server -s <path-to-your-settings-file>`.

You can also configure the path to the settings file with environment variable `SIGNALK_NODE_SETTINGS`.

The http port can be configured separately with environment variable `PORT`. You can also [run on port 80 with systemd](https://github.com/tkurki/marinepi-provisioning/blob/d3d624629799a3b96234a90fc42bc22dae4fd3a2/roles/node-app/templates/node_app_systemd_socket.j2). Environment variable NMEA0183PORT sets the NMEA 0183 tcp port.

Storing Configuration Outside The Server Install Directory
==========================================================
You can store configuration like the settings file, plugin cofiguration and defaults.js in a directory outside of the server install using the `-c` option (or the `SIGNALK_NODE_CONFIG_DIR` env variable).

By default, the server will look for a `settings.json` and a `defaults.json` file in the given directory.

For example, `./bin/signalk-server -c /usr/local/etc/node_server_config`

In this case, the server would look for the settings file at `/usr/local/etc/node_server_config/settings.json`

You can overwrite the default settings file name by specifying the -s argument.

For example, ./bin/signalk-server -c /usr/local/etc/node_server_config -s test_settings.json`

In this case, the server would look for the settings file at `/usr/local/etc/node_server_config/test_settings.json`

Environment variables
---------------------
- `SIGNALK_NODE_SETTINGS` override the path to the settings file.
- `SIGNALK_NODE_CONFIG_DIR` override the path to find server configuration files.
- `PORT` override the port for http/ws service (default is 3000).
- `SSLPORT` override the port for https/wss service. If defined activates ssl as forced, default protocol (default is 3443).
- `PROTOCOL` override http/https where the server is accessed via https but the server sees http (for example when Heroku handles https termination)
- `EXTERNALPORT` the port used in /signalk response and Bonjour advertisement. Has precedence over configuration file.
- `EXTERNALHOST` the host used in /signalk response and Bonjour advertisement. Has precedence over configuration file.
- `FILEUPLOADSIZELIMIT` override the file upload size limit (default is '10mb').
- `NMEA0183PORT`  override the port for the NMEA 0183 over tcp service (default is 10110).
- `TCPSTREAMPORT` override the port for the Signal K Streaming (deltas) over TCP.
- `TCPSTREAMADDRESS` override the address the Signal K Stream (deltas) over TCP is listening on.
- `DISABLEPLUGINS` disable all plugins so that they can not be enabled (default is false).
- `DEFAULTENABLEDPLUGINS` a comma separated list of plugin ids that are overridden to be enabled by default if no setttings exist. lower preference than `DISABLEPLUGINS`.
- `PLUGINS_WITH_UPDATE_DISABLED` a comma separated list of plugin that will not be updated.
- `SECURITYSTRATEGY` override the security strategy module name.
- `WSCOMPRESSION` compress websocket messages (default is false).
- `MAXSENDBUFFERSIZE` the maximum number of bytes allowed in the server's send buffer of a WebSocket connection. The connection will be terminated if this is exceeded. Guards against slow or dysfunctional clients that can not cope with the message volume (default is 512 * 1024 bytes).
- `SIGNALK_SERVER_IS_UPDATABLE` allows the server to be updated through the GUI even if it is not installed in the standard paths (default is false). if set to true, the server must have been installed with `npm install -g signalk-server`.
- `SIGNALK_DISABLE_SERVER_UPDATES` disables server updates in the GUI (default is false).
- `DEBUG` a comma-separated list of tags for debugging the specified module (For example: signalk-server*,signalk-provider-tcp). Can now be defined directly in the graphical interface.
 More help on how to use the debug here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug#wildcards
- `IS_IN_DOCKER` used to tell the server it is in Docker and not normally updateable (default is false).
- `NPMREGISTRYTIMEOUT` how long to wait for the registry when retrieving the App Store listing (default is 20s).
- `SECRETKEY` a secret string used to generate an authentication token (the internal default autogenerated is a string of 512 hex chars like 'ef8307a4c7a4bd7...309d947bca3')
- `ALLOW_DEVICE_ACCESS_REQUESTS` used when a device needs to gain access to a secured Signal K server (default is true) (https://signalk.org/specification/1.4.0/doc/access_requests.html).
- `ALLOW_NEW_USER_REGISTRATION` (default is true).
- `ADMINUSER` force a account for admin user (username:password format).
- `PRESERIALCOMMAND` command to run before opening a serial port.

Real Inputs
---------------
To hook the server up to your real inputs you need to create a configuration file that connects to your input source and applies the relevant parsers / converters in the provider pipeline.

Inputs are configured as an array of pipedProviders, each with an id and an array of pipeElements. You need to create a pipedProviders entry for each of your inputs. The pipedProvider must include 'id' (name of the interface, e.g. NMEA0183 from AIS could be called "AIS"). The first pipeElement is the source of the data ("providers/serialport" for a serial interface such as USB, "providers/filestream" if the data comes from a file, "providers/tcp" if the source is a TCP port etc.). You will see in the example settings that the second pipeElement is often "providers/liner". This is a pipeElement that splits the input into separate lines and passes one line at a time to the next pipeElement. The final pipeElement or group of pipeElements is where the translation or passing to the server occurs. For NMEA0183, this is "providers/nmea0183-signalk", for N2K (NMEA2000) it is "providers/n2kAnalyzer" and then "providers/n2k-signalk".

There are also special pipeElements such as "providers/log" (see below), and "providers/throttle" which changes the playback from files to the bytes per second rate set in the options. The "providers/execute" pipeElement lets you pass a command to the server, as set in the options.

Each PipeElement is configured with `options`. Different PipeElements use different configuration parameters, like for serialport you can configure baud rate and for udp connection the port.

A PipeElement may require some options entry that is available already in the configuration file (`nmea0183-signalk` needs the self id). This can be accomplished with [optionMappings property](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/5134ce5f48f25b2b270176f39d3e8e530dedb825/settings/volare-udp-settings.json#L34-L43).

You can also use optionMappings property to optionally override `options` entries with command line parameters. For example you can specify the data file for file playback from the command line as `bin/signalk-server -s settings/volare-file-settings.json --nmeafilename=samples/nais400-merrimac.log` with [this configuration](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/5134ce5f48f25b2b270176f39d3e8e530dedb825/settings/volare-file-settings.json#L28-L33).

Look through the examples in the settings folder and copy pipedProviders that suit your setup. You can combine as many as you want. See [multiple sources]( https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/multiple-sources.json) example

Make sure that the settings file you are using is valid JSON. This can be done in an online validator like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)

### NMEA0183

There is an example settings file for using NMEA 0183 input from a serial device that you can use to start up the server: `bin/signalk-server -s settings/volare-serial-settings.json`. You can change the `port` and `baudrate` in the [settings file](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-serial-settings.json#L23-L27).


### NMEA 2000 (via NGT-1 & Canboat)

There is an example settings file for N2K from N2K/CANBus. Make sure to change the command option to match the NGT-1 port like in this [example](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/actisense-serial-settings.json#L12)

### Signal K

A provider that handles Signal K deltas can be set up with the following elements:
- a source pipeElement (`providers/filestream`, `providers/serialport`, `providers/tcp`, `providers/udp`)
- `providers/liner`
- `providers/from_json`

Furthermore you can use data from a Signal K server with the `providers/mdns-ws` source. Without any configuration it will use the Signal K discovery process to discover any Signal K servers in the local network, such as iKommunicate, and connect to it. No other pipeElements are needed. See the [example configuration file](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/signalk-ws-settings.json). You can also configure `mdns-ws` with `host` and `port`, which will disable the discovery process and make it connect directly to the specified server.

### File

An input from a file uses the `providers/filestream`. The options to change are `filename` and `fromAppProperty` ,see [NMEA0183](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-file-settings.json#L23-L34) and [N2K](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/multiple-sources.json#L81-L82) examples.

### Serial

An input from a serial port uses the `providers/serialport` pipeElement. It takes the options `device` and `baudrate` and optionally "toStdout"(see [example](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-serial-settings.json#L25-L26)). `serialport` has an internal line splitter, so a **pipedProvider with serialport as the source does not need `liner` and will not work with one**.

### TCP

`providers/tcp` is a TCP client that can connect to a server and receive input from a TCP socket. It takes the options `host` and `port` (see [example](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-tcp-settings.json#L29-L30)).

### UDP

settings/volare-udp-settings provides an example of NMEA0183 input over UDP port 7777. If you have trouble getting this to work try setting up DEBUG environment variable with `export DEBUG=signalk-server:udp-provider` and sending manually input with netcat `echo  '$IIDBT,034.25,f,010.44,M,005.64,F*27' | nc -4u -w1 localhost 7777`. This should result in the server logging the NMEA sentence it receives. UDP source takes `port` option.

### GPSD

Please see [example settings files](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/volare-gpsd-settings.json).


Bonjour support
---------------

Bonjour support will be enabled by default if your system supports it and has the required software installed. See also https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns#installation for more information.

When Bonjour is enabled the server advertises itself via Bonjour. This means that Bonjour-aware software running in the same network can discover the Signal K server and access it. For example the server shows up in Safari at Bookmarks => Bonjour => Webpages.

You can disable Bonjour/mDNS by adding the entry `"mdns": false` to the config file. See `settings/volare-gpsd-settings.json` for example.

The server can also automatically discover other Signal K devices and connect to them. See `settings/signalk-ws-settings.json` for an example. If the incoming data should be treated as data about `self` the identity in the settings file and in the incoming data need to match or the incoming data should not include context, as the default is `self`.

HTTPS
-----
Https is not enabled by default. To enable it, set `"ssl":true` in the [settings file](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/settings/aava-non-ssl-file-settings.json#L9). If no `ssl-key.pem` & `ssl-cert.pem` files are found under settings they will be created. If you need to configure a certificate chain add it in `ssl-chain.pem` under settings.

By default the server listens to both http and https in the same port.

Logging
-------

You can log all the input data in pre-Signal K format by adding the `log` element to your pipeElement pipeline. It creates hourly files with the data from all the configured providers, interleaved/multiplexed with one message per line. The multiplexed log files can be played back with `multiplexedlog` pipeElement element. Please beware the standard discriminators in [multiplexedlog](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node/blob/master/providers/multiplexedlog.js). For extensive use of logging, please see [Cassiopeia](https://github.com/tkurki/cassiopeia-settings/blob/master/signalk-server-settings.json)

Server Plugins
-------

Plugin configuration interface is at [/plugins/configure](http://localhost:3000/plugins/configure/). See [Server Plugins](SERVERPLUGINS.md) for more information.

# Charts

Signal K chart support is provided by the [@signalk/charts-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@signalk/charts-plugin) plugin.

After installing and configuring the plugin from the admin console, use a client app such as [Freeboard SK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@signalk/freeboard-sk) or [Tuktuk Plotter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tuktuk-chart-plotter) to retrieve a list of charts and present them.

# Custom logo

You can change the admin application's top left logo by placing a SVG file named `logo.svg` in the settings directory (default: $HOME/.signalk/).

# Source Priority

You can specify relative precedence between sources for a single Signal K path.

The idea is that for a specific path you list sources in decreasing precedence with source specific timeouts.

Incoming data from a source is dropped (not handled at all) by the server if the previous value for the path is *from a source with higher precedence* and it is *not older than the timeout*.

The _source priority_ algorithm  compares the *latest value* that was passed through against a new value:
- is the latest value from a source that has a lower or equal priority than the incoming value's source? if true pass the value
- else: is the latest value older than the timeout for incoming source's timeout? if yes pass the value
- else: ignore the value

Note that the filtering takes place on *path level, not on delta level*: if a delta contains multiple path-value pairs some may be filtered out and others handled.

There is no timeout for the highest priority source, it is handled always.

Timeout for data from unlisted sources is 10 seconds.
